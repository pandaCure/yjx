2 Secure live migration with QEMU-native TLS

5 Context

8 The encryption offerred by Nova's ``[libvirt]/live_migration_tunnelled``
9 does not secure all the different migration streams of a Nova instance,
10 namely: guest RAM, device state, and disks (via NBD) when using
11 non-shared storage.  Further, the "tunnelling via libvirtd" has inherent
12 limitations: (a) it cannot handle live migration of disks in a
13 non-shared storage setup (a.k.a. "block migration"); and (b) has a huge
14 performance overhead and latency, because it burns more CPU and memory
15 bandwidth due to increased number of data copies on both source and
16 destination hosts.
17 
18 To solve this existing limitation, QEMU and libvirt has recently gained
19 (refer below for version details) support for "native TLS"—i.e. TLS
20 built into QEMU).  This will secure all data transports, including disks
21 that are not on shared storage—all of this without incurring the
22 limitations of the "tunnelled via libvirtd" transport.
23 
24 To take advantage of the "native TLS" support in QEMU and libvirt, Nova
25 has introduced new configuration attribute
26 ``[libvirt]/live_migration_with_native_tls``.

28 .. _`Prerequisites`:
29 
30 Prerequisites
31 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
32 
33 (1) Version requirement: This feature needs at least: libvirt 4.4.0 and
34     QEMU 2.11.
35 
36 (2) A pre-configured TLS environment—i.e. CA, server, and client
37     certificates, their file permissions, et al—must be "correctly"
38     configured (typically by an installer tool) on all relevant Compute
39     nodes.  To simplify your PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) setup, use
40     deployment tools that takes care of handling all the certificate
41     lifecycle management.  E.g. refer to the: "`TLS everywhere
42     <https://docs.openstack.org/tripleo-docs/latest/install/advanced_deployment/tls_everywhere.html>`__"
43     guide from the TripleO project.
44 
45 (3) Password-less SSH setup for all relevant Compute nodes.
46 
47 (4) On all relevant Compute nodes, ensure the following TLS-related
48     config attributes in ``/etc/libvirt/qemu.conf/`` are in place::
49 
50       default_tls_x509_cert_dir = "/etc/pki/qemu/"
51       default_tls_x509_verify = 1
52 
53     Refer to the "`Additional information`_" section further below on a
54     note about the other TLS-related configuration attributes in
55     ``/etc/libvirt/qemu.conf/``.
56 
57 Validating your TLS environment on Compute nodes
58 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
59 
60 Assuming you have two Compute hosts — ComputeNode1, and ComputeNode2 —
61 run the `virt-pki-validate` tool (comes with the 'libvirt-client'
62 package on your Linux distribution) on both the nodes to ensure all the
63 necessary PKI files are configured are configured::
64 
65     [ComputeNode1]$ virt-pki-validate
66     Found /usr/bin/certtool
67     Found CA certificate /etc/pki/CA/cacert.pem for TLS Migration Test
68     Found client certificate /etc/pki/libvirt/clientcert.pem for ComputeNode1
69     Found client private key /etc/pki/libvirt/private/clientkey.pem
70     Found server certificate /etc/pki/libvirt/servercert.pem for ComputeNode1
71     Found server private key /etc/pki/libvirt/private/serverkey.pem
72     Make sure /etc/sysconfig/libvirtd is setup to listen to
73     TCP/IP connections and restart the libvirtd service
74 
75     [ComputeNode2]$ virt-pki-validate
76     Found /usr/bin/certtool
77     Found CA certificate /etc/pki/CA/cacert.pem for TLS Migration Test
78     Found client certificate /etc/pki/libvirt/clientcert.pem for ComputeNode2
79     Found client private key /etc/pki/libvirt/private/clientkey.pem
80     Found server certificate /etc/pki/libvirt/servercert.pem for ComputeNode2
81     Found server private key /etc/pki/libvirt/private/serverkey.pem
82     Make sure /etc/sysconfig/libvirtd is setup to listen to
83     TCP/IP connections and restart the libvirtd service
84 
85 
86 Other TLS environemnt related checks on Compute nodes
87 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
88 
89 (1) On *both*, ComputeNode1, and ComputeNode2, update 'x509' config
90     options in ``/etc/libvirt/qemu.conf/``::
91 
92         default_tls_x509_cert_dir = "/etc/pki/qemu"
93         default_tls_x509_verify = 1
94 
95       And modify /etc/sysconfig/libvirtd on both (ComputeNode1 &
96       ComputeNode2)::
97 
98         LIBVIRTD_ARGS="--listen"
99 
100       And restart libvirt daemon (also on both nodes)::
101 
102         $ systemctl restart libvirtd
103 
104 (2) **IMPORTANT**: Ensure that the  permissions of certificate files
105     and keys in ``/etc/pki/qemu/*`` directory on both source *and*
106     destination Compute nodes to be the following::
107 
108         [root@ComputeNode1 ~]$ ls -lasrtZ /etc/pki/qemu
109         total 32

131 ~~~~
132 
133 (1) On all relevant Compute nodes, ensure to enable the
134     ``live_migration_with_native_tls`` configuration attribute (and
135     restart the libvirt daemon)::
136 
137        [libvirt]
138        live_migration_with_native_tls = true
139 
140    ..note::
141       Setting both ``live_migration_tunnelled`` *and*
142       ``live_migration_with_native_tls`` at the same time is invalid
143       (and disallowed).
144 
145 (2) Migrate guests with and without  shared storage from ComputeNode1 to
146     ComputeNode2 *with* TLS.  Refer to the :doc:`live-migration-usage`
147     document on details on live migration.
148 
149 
150 .. _`Additional information`:
151 
152 Additional information
153 ----------------------
154 
155 - If you have the relevant libvirt and QEMU versions (mentioned in the
156   "`Prerequisites`_" section earlier), then using the
157   ``live_migration_with_native_tls`` is strongly recommended over the
158   more limited ``live_migration_tunnelled`` option—which is intended to
159   be deprecated in future.
160 
161 - There are in total *nine* TLS-related config options in
162   ``a/etc/libvirt/qemu.conf``::
163 
164       default_tls_x509_cert_dir
165       default_tls_x509_verify
166       nbd_tls
167       nbd_tls_x509_cert_dir
168       migrate_tls_x509_cert_dir
169 
170       vnc_tls_x509_cert_dir
171       spice_tls_x509_cert_dir
172       vxhs_tls_x509_cert_dir
173       chardev_tls_x509_cert_dir
174 
175   If you set both ``default_tls_x509_cert_dir`` and
176   ``default_tls_x509_verify`` parameters for all certificates, then no
177   need to specify any of the other ``*_tls*`` config options.
178 
179   The intention (of libvirt) is that you can just use the
180   ``default_tls_x509_*`` config attributes—that way you don't need to
181   set any other ``*_tls*`` parameters, _unless_ you need different
182   certificates for some services.  The rationale for that is that some
183   services (e.g.  migration / NBD)  are only exposed to internal
184   infrastructure; while some sevices (VNC, Spice) might be exposed
185   publically, so might need different certificates.  For OpenStack this
186   doesn't matter, though, we'll stick with the defaults.
187 
188 - Sometimes you may need to stop ``firewalld`` on both ComputeNode1 and
189   ComputeNode2 (otherwise you get: ``error: internal error: unable to
190   execute QEMU command 'drive-mirror': Failed to connect socket: No
191   route to host``)::
192 
193     $ systemctl stop firewalld
